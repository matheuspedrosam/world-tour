<h3>Even to meet your own town, who never was bored and didn't know what to do? 😵‍💫🥱</h3>

➡️ Each city contains its own categories (Beaches, Restaurants, Shopping Malls, Nightclubs, etc.).

⭐ Every city will have a category called "Iconic" (featuring the most famous spots, regardless of category—does that make sense?). For example: Paris – Eiffel Tower, Seine River, Louvre Museum...

➡️ Within the categories, there are places.

➡️ Each category may or may not have subcategories (e.g., Shopping Malls > [Restaurants, Cinemas, etc.]).

➡️ Each place will have its own description or contact information. For instance, restaurants may include their menu and a "Contact Us" button!

🔝 Users can also leave comments and view reviews for each place. 😎

➡️ This is super helpful for tourism, right?

➡️ There will also be a "blog" section for each city where tourists can leave tips for other travelers! Who doesn’t love those money-saving hacks? 🐷🪙

🤩 Places can become our partners and show up in the "Recommended" section!

💸 And for any client we refer to a private partner location, we’ll earn a commission!

🙌 So, everyone ends up happy!
